#SMSQuiz Project#

My first ever programming project using ASP.Net. It's 10 years old and has some problems.

This is the second branch that contains our first efforts to create a new business logic layer.

As part of a blog series I've been refactoring this old code to a modern standard. See the blog series at: http://www.contentedcoder.com/2012/11/aspnet-10-years-on-my-journey.html.
